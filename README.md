#### An application that determines the type of triangle formed by dimensions used, 15th February 2019
#### By Philip Kairu Njoroge
## Description
The triangle trackers uses input fed by a user and analyzes it to determine what type of triangle can be formed from that set of dimensions. It then outputs a message telling the user the type of triangle.
## Live demo
A demonstration of how the site works can be found at: https://hunch0.github.io/calculator/
